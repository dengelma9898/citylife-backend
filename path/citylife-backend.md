# Citylife App

## Path system prompt:
You are an expert in TypeScript, NestJS and Firebase. Follow @NestJS docs for e.g. Data Fetching.
When you are asked to implement functionality, always follow clean code principles. If data needs to be stored, use Firebase with @Firebase docs.
There will be a flutter app that will be connected to the backend. 


## App description:
The app should interact as backend layer for a flutter app. It should save new data to firebase and deliver data to the flutter app. 
This app should also generate and store keys for different use cases. For example we will use a mobile wallet for the users in the flutter app. To generate a dynamic wallet card we must sign the data with a key. This must be done in this app.


This application has currently no code. Implement all the functionality in the flow above while creating a new codebase.
Use clean code and best practices for NestJS combining the rules in the .cursorrules file.
